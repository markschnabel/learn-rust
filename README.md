# Learn Rustlang
This repository contains a series of projects done in order to learn the Rust programming language. The projects will be primarily done based off of [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDF6BX6_RdPisRVHgzV02NW) by [TensorProgramming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYqCZOwHbnPwyjawKfE21wg), but as I progress with the language I plan to add my own features and modifications to all the projects.
